# Features

![JArmEmu Editor](https://static.dwightstudio.fr/jarmemu/PNG/SHOWCASE/CUPERTINO_LIGHT.png)

JArmEmu is a simple, user-friendly simulator that provides basic control and information about a simulated ARMv7
architecture.

JArmEmu is powered by an ARMv7 interpreter built *Ex Nihilo* for this project, which provides real-time syntax
highlighting, intelligent auto-completion, memory, stack and register monitoring...

You can write your program using ARMv7 instructions and commonly used GNU directives, and watch the simulator execute
it with details on any step.

> [!NOTE]
> The implemented instruction set is available directly in the simulator (Help > See instructions...).
