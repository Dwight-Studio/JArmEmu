# JArmEmu
### Simple ARMv7 simulator written in Java, intended for educational purpose.

## Features
JArmEmu is a simple, user-friendly simulator that provides basic control and information about a simulated ARMv7 architecture.

JArmEmu is powered by an ARMv7 interpreter built *Ex Nihilo* for this project, which provides real-time syntax highlighting,
intelligent auto-completion, memory, stack and register monitoring...

You can write your program using the ARMv7 instruction set (refer to
[Instructions.md](https://github.com/Dwight-Studio/JArmEmu/blob/main/Instructions.md)) and include GNU Assembly directives (only the basic ones are implemented, you can refer to syntax
highlighting or auto-completion to see if it is available).
